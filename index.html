  <!-- We have two options of how to bring in pyodide. -->
  <!-- The first option brings it in using a cdn. As long as this is working, there's no reason not to use it -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.23.4/full/pyodide.js"></script>

  <!-- The second option uses a locally-hosted version of pyodide. -->
  <!-- <script src="pyodide/pyodide.js"></script> -->


  <!-- The local version is good to have around in case something happens to the cdn version (which is outside our control) -->
  <!-- But, the local version will burn through our bandwidth and will require us to do more setup with .whl files. -->
  <!-- So, as long as the cdn version is working, we should stick to that option -->
  <!-- If we change versions here, we also need to update the micropip.install() call to point at .whl files -->
